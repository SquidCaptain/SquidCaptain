## ðŸš€ About me
ðŸ‘‹ I am George Yeh, a **software developer** intrested in many different areas all the way from **web developement** to **AI**.

ðŸ˜„ I enjoy working on projects and am enthusiastic about current and emerging technologies and is always looking to discover new ways to apply them. 
From learning C++, Python, Java, and some programming basics while in university to learning Tensorflow, Flask, React, and more after graduation, I have accumulated a reservoir of skills that I am building apon constantly.

ðŸ“– Outside of tech, I enjoy stories whether by movies, TV shows, or books. I love stories that incorporate mysterious elements that leans towards lovecraftian horror.
