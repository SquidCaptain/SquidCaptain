## 🚀 About Me

👋 Hi, I’m **George** a developer currently pursuing a Master’s in Engineering with a strong interest in **Data Science, Machine Learning, and full-stack development**.

I enjoy building projects end-to-end: from gathering and manipulating data, to training machine learning models and creating web applications. I’m especially interested in applying data and ML to solve real-world problems.

Over time, I’ve built a solid technical foundation through both academic work and hands-on projects, working with technologies such as **Python, SQL, PostgreSQL, TensorFlow, Flask, React**. I’m always exploring new tools and frameworks to deepen my skill set and improve how I translate data into impact.

📖 Outside of tech, I’m a big fan of storytelling, whether through movies, TV shows, or books, particularly stories with mysterious or Lovecraftian elements.
